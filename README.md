# Spotify User Profile Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project is a personal web application that displays insights about a user's Spotify profile. It's primarily designed as a learning experience to gain hands-on experience with full-stack web development.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are:

1. To gain practical experience in full-stack web development
2. To learn and implement the Svelte framework
3. To work with data from external APIs (Spotify Web API)
4. To practice database design and management with PostgreSQL
5. To improve skills in front-end design and data visualization

## Technologies Used

- **Front-end**: Svelte, HTML5, CSS3
- **Back-end**: Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **API**: Spotify Web API
- **ETL Process**: Custom Python script to extract, transform, and load data

## Project Structure

1. **ETL Process**: A separate project that pulls data from the Spotify Web API and stores it in a PostgreSQL database.
2. **Web Application**: A Svelte app that displays the user's Spotify data in an interactive dashboard.

## Current Status

The project is in its initial stages. The front-end template has been created using HTML and CSS, with guidance from Claude AI. This template has been incorporated into a new Svelte app. The next steps involve:

1. Connecting the Svelte app to the PostgreSQL database
2. Implementing data visualization components
3. Adding interactivity to the dashboard
4. Refining the design and user experience
